Moreover, they think that all have same features and offers same level of protection. As a result they don’t even concentrate on what product they are using and trust any <strong>antivirus dealer</strong> for buying the crucial protection element of their pc.

They don’t scan in real-time means scanning would be done manually. And most of the users forget to manually scan the software for detecting virus. On the other hand, good software will have dynamic scanning features. It will check the computer repeatedly for detecting the malicious entities presence. This feature is therefore very crucial. 
      <br>
      <br>

        The paid products have far better features than free version. The <strong>quick heal dealer sales app</strong> has a file shredder, in-built ransomware protection, a password manager, and a hardened browser that enables user safe surfing. However, a yearly subscription is required to use the software license for long. Luckily, some of the software dealers in india offers discount on next subscription or first time subscription.
        <br>
