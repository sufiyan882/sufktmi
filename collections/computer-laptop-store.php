        <h2>How to choose your  Desktop and laptop?</h2>
        <p>Today's world is essentially based on digital. Having a laptop is more than a necessity than a luxury. But starting from a large capacity hard drive like HDD or SSD to an NVIDIA graphics card via a 6th generation processor, the components of a laptop are multiple. However, each of them depends on the performance of your equipment. Connectivity and connectivity offer you greater possibilities for expansion. You can buy online <strong>laptops for business purpose in jaipur, Rajasthan</strong>.
          <br>
          So we have designed a small summary on the basic criteria that are taken into account when choosing a good equipment. Here are the main criteria for choosing a good quality laptop, according to the various uses that can be made of it. You can easily find the <a href="<?= base_url ?>collections/computer-laptop-store"><strong>Dell Desktop Computer dealers in Jaipur</strong></a> .

      <div class="product_about_text">
        <h2 class="padd">The important criteria for choosing desktop and laptop</h2>
        <p><li><strong>The screen</strong></li>
        You will find this implausible, but the size of the screen is by far the most important criterion since it determines the dimensions of the computer. Since the main reason for choosing a laptop is ease of transport, because the larger the screen, the more cumbersome it is. But it shouldn't be too small either. You also prefer to notebooks from <a href="<?= base_url ?>products/dell-vostro-15-3590-15-6-inch-laptop-core-i5-4gb-1tb-windows10home"><strong>buy online the best laptops notebooks in jaipur</strong></a> or seach the <strong>best place in Jaipur to buy dell laptops</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><strong>The processor</strong></li>
        Wanting a suitable model for displacement does not imply resorting to mediocrity, this is the reason why you must watch over the processor. It represents the heart of the computer. It is responsible for the execution of programs and the management of calculations. <strong>dell desktop i5 7th generation</strong> is one the good option in term of processor from <a href="<?= base_url ?>products/dell-vostro-15-3590-15-6-inch-laptop-core-i5-4gb-1tb-windows10home"><strong>top 10 laptop dealers in jaipur</strong></a>.
        <br>
        This increases the speed of information processing which is determined by the clock rate (GHz). The higher this value, the more your device performs. So depending on your choice on this component, you will have quick equipment or not..
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Capacity</strong></li>
        We will talk here about RAM memory. It serves as a storage medium for any activity in progress. The greater its capacity, the faster the data processing. A professional PC does not require as much RAM as a Gaming model (PC designed for video game enthusiasts). If you are in an area that requires you to open several working windows, a large RAM would be more profitable for you. The <strong>Dell and hp laptop store in jaipur</strong> can customised the laptops according to needs.
        <br>
        In addition, the hard drive is an essential component. . All your data is stored there even after a power failure. This allows you to access it at any time. The computer will not function without this component, since it also houses the operating system which represents the interface of the entire system.
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><strong>The video card</strong></li>
      This component is of paramount importance for everything related to multimedia. The video card does the graphic processing of any application launched on the computer. In simpler terms, a good video card is essential for everything related to multimedia display (movie playback, video processing or video game).
      <br>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Connectivity</strong></li>
    It brings together several technologies. Bluetooth, a wireless connection ideal for connection to external devices such as a speaker or headphones. A Bluetooth version 3.1 is much more efficient than a version 2.0. Wifi, also known as WLAN, allows you to connect without using any cable. . It gives you mobile internet access and is ideal for data transfer. An Ethernet port is also essential for a wired LAN and Internet connection.
    <br>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Connectors</strong></li>
  This group includes any physical connection to an external device. The most common is USB, it gives you the possibility of connecting several external devices (Scanner, printer, webcam, external hard drive) to your PC. In addition, you can also use it for data transfer by USB stick. There are several versions of USB port.Your PC should also have an HDMI port (to connect peripherals like a television or a video projector), a jack port (for any connection of audio peripherals).
In addition, a good computer needs an optical disc drive. Some laptops do not have them. But this device is very useful for installing software or playing video files. This player allows you to play CDs and DVDs. In addition, some models have an integrated burner which allows you to save your data on an external medium.
<br>
<br>
<li><strong>Budget</strong></li>
The amount you have planned for the purchase of your laptop undoubtedly determines the performance of the latter. It is advised to buy laptop from <a href="<?= base_url ?>collections/computer-laptop-store"><strong>authorised laptop brand dealers in jaipur</strong></a>. 
<br>In simple terms, the more you pay for it, the more you get efficient equipment. However, a low-cost computer can have everything you need depending on how you want to use it.
<br>
<br>
<li><strong>For the curious:</strong></li>
<a href="<?= base_url ?>products/dell-vostro-15-3590-15-6-inch-laptop-core-i5-4gb-1tb-windows10home"><strong>buy latest laptops</strong></a> is a tricky business. The commercial <strong>purpose business laptop price list in India, Jaipur</strong> is very affordable
<br>
If you neglect a criterion, you may regret your investment. But your decision must be guided by the use you intend to make of it. The resolution of a laptop for Gaming differs widely from a professional model. Make a wise choice so as not to waste your money on equipment of questionable quality.

The times in which those who carry a laptop in the backpack were a punishment have gone down in history. Nowadays very extended, the Ultrabooks are very thin laptops (less than 21 mm thick) and of low weight (less than 2kg ). The idea is to offer power in a small space thanks to Intel processors. To achieve this reduction, manufacturers use solid memory disks (SSD) with which, in addition to gaining space, make operating system start-up and data transfer much faster.
More and more manufacturers are betting on this format, and today companies have very interesting models. If you want more information about ultra books, here we explain in detail. You can buy it from store just search dell store near me.

On the one hand those in which you can rotate the screen or those where we can separate keyboard and screen. They are one of the most trending options in the market and are worth considering and you can buy it on <a href="<?= base_url ?>#"><strong>Computer Store in Jaipur</strong></a>.
